# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1
## Documenting the current environment

I know this was not part of the template for this assignment, but Prof Peng 
mentions in the week 3 lectures that part of the Reproducible Research workflow 
is to document the environment that the analysis is run in (just in case there 
are issues that relate to a specific version).  

I have therefore put in this 
section to remind myself later how to do this...


```r
sessionInfo()
```

```
